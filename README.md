# CSCI3308_Project
Project for CSCI 3308 in Spring 2015
Created by Brandon Boylan-Peck (shadow9692), Eric Hardwick (FlintTD), Kevin Holligan (kholligan), and Robby Kendl (DomoYeti)

A pass-and-play computerized version of Axis and Allies, 2004 Revised Edition.

Should provide all of the fun and functionality of the game, without the prohibitive setup and play times.
